# Population Logistic Growth Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploring **logistic growth models**.  
This tool helps visualize how populations evolve under resource constraints, with adjustable parameters for carrying capacity, growth rate, and initial population.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📈 **Population curve visualization** (logistic growth over time)
- ⚡ Adjustable parameters: carrying capacity (K), growth rate (r), initial population (P₀), and time horizon
- 🔄 **Scenario comparison**: overlay multiple runs to see differences
- 🎨 Clean, client‑friendly UI with sidebar controls
- 📊 Export plots in publication‑quality format (300 DPI)

---

## 🧮 Applications
- Biology & Ecology → species population dynamics
- Epidemiology → disease spread under constraints
- Economics & Business → product adoption, market saturation
- Education → teaching logistic growth concepts interactively
